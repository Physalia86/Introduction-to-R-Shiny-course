# Introduction to R Shiny {.unnumbered}

**Dates**  
27-28 January 2025  
**To foster international participation, this course will be held online.**

## Overview

Strictly speaking, Shiny is an R package; however, it surpasses this classification.
It stands as a framework that empowers R users to craft sophisticated,
responsive web applications, even with a modest grasp of web development.
But why do we consider it a framework?
The reason lies in the multitude of packages that expand Shiny's
functionality, enabling the execution of intricate processes.
Moreover, this ecosystem continues to expand daily.
To fully harness the capabilities of Shiny, one must grasp its fundamental principles.
In this workshop, we will delve deeply into these concepts.
By the conclusion of the session,
you will be well-equipped to confidently create web applications directly from within R.

## Target Audience

This workshop is targeting a broad audience:  

- Data Analysts  
- Data Scientists  
- Researchers  
- Biologists  
- Economists  

Among others. These participants all share the benefit of enhanced productivity and insight through the implementation of web applications.

## Prerequisites

- A basic proficiency in R is required.
- Some knowledge of `dplyr` and `ggplot2` would be beneficial as we’ll use them to build our applications.
- Familiarity with the RStudio IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is preferable.
- **No knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript is required.**

## Tools

The following tools need to be installed beforehand:

- **R**: Available at [R download](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/). It’s ok if you don’t have the latest version.
- **RStudio**: [Download RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)
- **Shiny**: Install the latest stable release via `install.packages("shiny")`
- **Tidyverse**: Install via `install.packages("tidyverse")`
- A modern web browser (preferably Google Chrome).

## Learning Outcomes

After completing the workshop, you’ll be able to:

- Understand the structure of a Shiny application.
- Read and understand the code used to create a Shiny app.
- Gain a solid knowledge of Shiny reactivity concepts.
- Create a Shiny app and deploy it to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).
