It stands as a framework that empowers R users to craft sophisticated, responsive web applications, even with a modest grasp of web development. But why do we consider it a framework? The reason lies in the multitude of packages that expand Shiny’s functionality, enabling the execution of intricate processes. Moreover, this ecosystem continues to expand daily. To fully harness the capabilities of Shiny, one must grasp its fundamental principles. In this workshop, we will delve deeply into these concepts. By the conclusion of the session, you will be well-equipped to confidently create web applications directly from within R.",
